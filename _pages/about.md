<strong>Menghan Hu (胡孟晗)</strong> works as an Associate Professor and Ph.D. supervisor at School of Communication Electronic Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai. I’m also the Director of the Rehabilitation Assistance and Health Promotion Professional Committee of the Shanghai Society of Image and Graphics, and was selected for the Shanghai Chen Guang Scholars Program and the Shanghai Yangfan Talents Program in 2019. <br>
I am interested in <strong>Computer Vision and its applications in the fields of Medicine and Agriculture:</strong><br>
📌 Intelligent Information Processing for Rehabilitation Medicine, e.g., Computer Vision-based Screening for Ophthalmic Diseases.<br>
📌 Non-contact Physiological Signal Detection, e.g., Camera-based Algorithms for Predicting Respiration, Blood Oxygenation, and Heart Rate, etc.<br>
📌 GAN-/Diffusion-based AIGC researches, e.g., multi-modal image/video generation, multi-modal human-centric editing and generation, etc.<br>

💬 Feel free to drop me emails ( mhhu@ce.ecnu.edu.cn ) if you have interests on above topics, and remote cooperations are welcomed.<br>
💬 If you are interested in my research topic and are currently applying for a master's/PhD, feel free to contact me. I have a certain number of master's and PhD positions available annually.<br>

💖 I am endeavoring to pursue some fascinating endeavors.
